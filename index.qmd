I am a data scientist and boy do I love me some data and some science! 

I do all kinds of data stuff in my job but I also tutor stats subjects at UQ and do a couple of nerdy hobbies. 

In spite of appearances I am not a Paleontologist. I just know a photogenic [ornithischian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischia) when I see one.
