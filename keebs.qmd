title: "Why I Like Weird Keyboards"
---

In short: The standard keyboard layout we are all used to hasn't had any proper 
design attention since typewriters were first invented. So someone 
taking a fresh look at how we get text into a computer today might come up with 
a different solution. At the very least the way the keys are arranged might be 
a little different?

I don't think this is for everyone, but I wanted to explore what this might look 
like. So here I am! I have two weird keyboards!
